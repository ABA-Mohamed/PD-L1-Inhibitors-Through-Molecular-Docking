# PD-L1-Inhibitors-Through-Molecular-Docking
Supporting materials and appendices for the study on PD-L1 inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy (ABA et al. 2025)

**Abstract**. The development of novel therapeutic molecules is imperative to the advancement of cancer treatment and the enhancement of patient outcomes. Despite the advancements in chemotherapeutic agents, the identification of highly effective options remains a substantial challenge, underscoring the necessity for further research to address the intricacies of this disease. The present study endeavored to identify molecules capable of inhibiting the PD-L1 receptor, with the objective of enhancing immunotherapy and fortifying the immune system's capacity to combat tumors. Molecules were retrieved from PubChem and ChEMBL databases, while PD-L1 was sourced from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock Vina, with PyMOL and Discovery Studio Visualizer (DSV) utilized for interaction analysis. Pharmacokinetic properties were predicted using SwissADME, and ADMET profiles were evaluated via pkCSM. The screening process was conducted in accordance with established therapeutic chemistry criteria. Among the candidates, N-phenethylcinnamamide demonstrated strong binding affinity for the PD-L1 receptor's active site, along with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, supporting its potential for oral administration. Subsequent structural modifications of this scaffold yielded 11 derivatives, including three phytochemical compounds, which exhibited enhanced binding energy and improved ADMET profiles. These findings underscore the potential of plant-derived molecules in cancer immunotherapy, providing a promising foundation for the development of innovative treatments.

N-Phenethylcinnamamide is an organic compound that has a cinnamamide skeleton to which a phenylethyl group is bonded. This compound can exist in different isomeric forms due to the possibility of rotation around the carbon bonds in the phenylethyl group. It can also undergo various chemical modifications on its cinnamamide backbone or phenylethyl group. After optimization, Fifty-five molecules derived from the base molecule (N-Phenethylcinnamamide), and are presented in **Table 1.**

After substantial filtering, seventeen compounds were evaluated for their pharmacological properties, and eleven were identified as suitable for oral administration, supported by favorable pharmacokinetic assessments and a comprehensive ADMET profile. These eleven compounds, determined by the numerical codes **25, 43, 5, 11, 42, 55, 2, 48, 29, 3, and 51,** demonstrated promising potential as PD-L1 inhibitors. The interaction and 2D structures of these eleven hit ligands interacting with the PD-L1 protein are shown in **Table 2**, listed in decreasing order of affinity energy.
